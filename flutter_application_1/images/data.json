        "article": "<p>Cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field that requires professionals to stay on their toes at all times. As technology and the threat landscape change, new cybersecurity terms are being introduced every day. To help keep you up to date with the latest trends, we&#39;ve compiled a list of five cybersecurity keywords you should know in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1 - AI-Driven Security Solutions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven security solutions are becoming increasingly popular as they can detect threats quickly and accurately using algorithms. This type of solution is perfect for organizations that need to monitor their networks 24/7 without any human intervention. AI-driven security solutions are also more efficient than manual processes, which can be time consuming and costly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2 - Cyber Security Posture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Security posture is a term used to describe the overall security of an organization. It&rsquo;s important for organizations to assess their current posture and take steps to ensure that their systems, processes and people are protected from cyber threats. A strong security posture will enable an organization to respond quickly and appropriately should a threat be detected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3 - Continuous Scanning</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://securityforeveryone.com/products/continuous-security\" target=\"_blank\">Continuous scanning</a> is a process of constantly evaluating an organization&#39;s cybersecurity posture for weak spots or vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to cyberattacks or data breaches. This process includes scanning networks for vulnerabilities, assessing assets for potential risks, and monitoring user activities for suspicious activity. Continuous scanning is essential for any organization looking to ensure their network remains secure against emerging threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4 - Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A threat intelligence platform (TIP) is an advanced security system designed to collect, analyze and report on cyberthreats in order to better protect organizations from attacks. TIPs give organizations real-time visibility into their security posture by collecting information from multiple sources such as logs, emails, social media posts and other sources of external intelligence. This helps them identify potential threats before they become serious problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 - Zero Trust Security Model</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The zero trust security model is a concept based on the idea that no one inside or outside an organization should be trusted unless they have been given explicit permission by the organization itself. In this model, users must always authenticate themselves before being granted access to resources within an organization&#39;s network infrastructure, regardless of whether they are connecting internally or externally. This approach helps strengthen security by continuously verifying user identity instead of relying solely on predetermined access controls or rulesets set up in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cybersecurity is constantly evolving and it&rsquo;s important for anyone working in the industry&mdash;or even just running a business&mdash;to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in order to remain secure online! We hope this list has given you a better understanding of some of the most important cybersecurity terms you should know in 2023 so you can ensure your business&#39; safety against cyberattacks!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, by understanding these five concepts you&#39;ll be able to have a better understanding of the cybersecurity landscape and can more easily protect your business from any potential threats. By keeping up with the latest trends in this field, you can also make sure that your organization stays secure against emerging cyberattacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good luck.</p>\r\n"

        "article": "<p>The number of cyber-attacks has been increasing rapidly. Businesses of all sizes must take responsibility for protecting themselves and customers&rsquo; data from cyber-attacks by investing in cybersecurity solutions. However, this can come at a hefty price tag, leaving many small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) struggling to find the resources to invest in such measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although defending may require some capital, attacking is effortless, inexpensive, and automated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cybersecurity costs can quickly become prohibitively expensive, but there are some steps SBMs can take to reduce those costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Number 1 - Utilize Automation Tools</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attacking is automated:</strong> Nowadays, attackers are using automated tools to launch cyber-attacks more easily and at a faster rate. Automated tools allow attackers to conduct malicious activities without having to do any manual operation. They can quickly scan the internet for vulnerable systems, launch multiple attacks simultaneously, and make attacks across networks with minimal effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your tech stacks are searchable:</strong> Also, there are lots of services that make your website technologies searchable over the internet. This make it easier for attackers to identify the outdated and vulnerable services of an organization, making them more susceptible to cyber-attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New vulnerabilities are discovered each day:</strong> Cybersecurity is an ever-changing landscape, with new vulnerabilities being discovered every day. This makes it difficult for organizations to keep up with the latest threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How? </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Using automated vulnerability scanning tools:</strong> Automated security solutions can help SBMs save time and money by helping them detect and respond to attacks more quickly and effectively. Additionally, some automation tools are designed to help organizations identify vulnerable points to patch them more quickly, reducing their attack surface. SMBs can easily automate vulnerability scanning, and alerting processes. Some examples are;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://securityforeveryone.com/products/continuous-security\" target=\"_blank\">https://securityforeveryone.com/products/continuous-security</a> (our product)</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://detectify.com/product/application-scanning\" target=\"_blank\">https://detectify.com/product/application-scanning</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner\" target=\"_blank\">https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.intruder.io/continuous-vulnerability-management\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.intruder.io/continuous-vulnerability-management</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://probely.com/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\">https://probely.com/enterprise/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Number 2 - Educate Employees on Cybersecurity Practices </strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why? </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reduce human mistakes:</strong> Your employees are the first line of defense against cyber-attacks. They can easily make mistakes and introduce vulnerabilities to your systems if they lack cybersecurity awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increase employee productivity:</strong> Additionally, it is important that all employees have basic knowledge of security protocols and processes so they don&rsquo;t waste time trying to figure out how to do something securely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attackers may target them: </strong>Attackers may try to exploit employees by targeting them directly with phishing or other malicious emails. If just one of your developer&#39;s systems is compromised, attackers can gain access to the entire system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How? </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use cyber security newsletter: </strong>This method allows you to quickly distribute information about the latest security threats and solutions. You can use a cyber security newsletter as a way to deliver timely security tips and news to your employees on a regular basis.

Additionally, it gives them an opportunity to practice their skills and gain better understanding of how to defend against cyber-attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://securityforeveryone.com/products/awareness-kit\" target=\"_blank\">https://securityforeveryone.com/products/awareness-kit</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.eset.com/us/cybertraining/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eset.com/us/cybertraining/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.infosecinstitute.com/iq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.infosecinstitute.com/iq/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://alison.com/course/digital-and-cyber-security-awareness\" target=\"_blank\">https://alison.com/course/digital-and-cyber-security-awareness</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdCnBmWXcAA\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdCnBmWXcAA</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Number 3 - Engage Professional Security Service Providers </strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why? </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gain access to expert advice: </strong>Cybersecurity is a complex field and requires expertise to navigate it successfully. It is often best to leave security tasks in the hands of experts who have experience with different threat scenarios. Otherwise, your investments might be wasted and your security objectives not met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automated tools have limits: </strong> Automated vulnerability scanners and other security tools may not be able to detect all possible threats. Professional services can provide more comprehensive coverage and help you identify vulnerabilities that automated solutions might miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Using penetration testing services: </strong> Penetration testing is a way of testing the security of your systems by simulating attacks from an outside source. This can help you identify weaknesses in your overall security posture and take steps to mitigate them before they are exploited. Automated tools can not provide the same depth and accuracy as a professional penetration tester. Some examples;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://securityforeveryone.com/penetration-testing-services\" target=\"_blank\">https://securityforeveryone.com/penetration-testing-services</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.cobalt.io/services/pentest-service\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cobalt.io/services/pentest-service</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/assessment-advisory/application-software/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nccgroup.com/us/assessment-advisory/application-software/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/services/prepare/penetration-testing-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.crowdstrike.com/services/prepare/penetration-testing-exercise/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.breachlock.com/penetration-testing-service/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.breachlock.com/penetration-testing-service/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Number 4 - Use Hardening Checklists</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remove well-known weaknesses:</strong> Hardening is the process of making your systems more secure by applying various security measures. This includes things like disabling unnecessary services, setting up firewalls, using strong passwords, and many more. Hardening is an effective way of reducing cyber security costs. It enables organizations to better protect their systems from malicious attacks and reduce the cost associated with recovering from a breach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reduce attack surface:</strong> Using a hardening checklist can help you quickly identify any potential weaknesses in your system and ensure that all security measures are applied correctly. This can reduce your attack surface and make it harder for attackers to gain access to your systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Using hardening checklists:</strong> There are many different types of hardening checklists available online that you can use to assess the security of your system. These checklists can help you quickly identify any potential weaknesses in your system and take steps to mitigate them. Some examples are;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/decalage2/awesome-security-hardening\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/decalage2/awesome-security-hardening</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/trimstray/linux-hardening-checklist\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/trimstray/linux-hardening-checklist</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PaulSec/awesome-windows-domain-hardening\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/PaulSec/awesome-windows-domain-hardening</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.first.org/resources/guides/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.first.org/resources/guides/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Number 5 - Backups</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protect against data loss:</strong> Backing up your data is a critical part of any security strategy. This ensures that you have a copy of all your important data in the event that it is lost or damaged due to an attack or other unforeseen event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ensure business continuity:</strong> If a disaster happens, having backups can help minimize disruption and ensure that you can quickly resume operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Ransomware is a type of malware that can encrypt your data and hold it, hostage, until you pay the attacker. Backing up your data regularly can help protect against this type of attack, as you will be able to restore any affected files from the backup.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Implementing a backup strategy: </strong> It is important to have a comprehensive backup strategy in place to protect your systems and data. This should include regular backups of all critical data as well as testing of the backups to make sure they are working properly. Additionally, it is important to store the backups securely off-site in case of physical disasters. Some examples are;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.carbonite.com/products/carbonite-safe-cloud-backup\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.carbonite.com/products/carbonite-safe-cloud-backup</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.officesolutionsit.com.au/blog/backups-101-best-backup-strategy-for-small-and-medium-business\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.officesolutionsit.com.au/blog/backups-101-best-backup-strategy-for-small-and-medium-business</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/snapshots/\" target=\"_blank\">https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/snapshots/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://crossclave.com/one/\" target=\"_blank\">https://crossclave.com/one/</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.idrive.com/online-backup-features\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.idrive.com/online-backup-features</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, it is essential for businesses to take the necessary steps to secure their networks from attack. By using services like automated vulnerability scanners, penetration testing, hardening checklists and backups, businesses can ensure that their data is kept secure and reduce the risk of a successful attack. Additionally, it is important to remember that security is an ongoing process; organizations should constantly review their security posture and update their defenses as needed.

        "article": "<p>Websites are one of the most important parts of any business. They can be used for marketing, customer service, and sales purposes and even help you create a stronger brand presence. But with all the power that websites provide comes a responsibility to protect them from being hacked or otherwise compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving your <a href=\"https://securityforeveryone.com/products/unlimited-on-demand-usage\" target=\"_blank\">website security</a> posture is essential if you want to protect your business&rsquo;s data and reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are six things you can do to make sure your website stays safe and secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1) Implement Strong Passwords</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using strong passwords is one of the most important steps you can take in keeping your website secure. Make sure all accounts (domain panel, hosting management system, FTP, SSH, admin panel, regular users, etc) associated with your website use complex passwords that include upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, try not to reuse passwords across different accounts and consider using a password manager for added security.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2) Use Secure Hosting Platforms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The hosting platform on which your website is hosted will play a major role in how secure it is from cyber threats. Make sure you are using hosting services from reputable providers who offer features like automated backups and 24/7 customer support. Additionally, look into utilizing cloud-based hosting solutions as they often come with built-in security measures such as strong privileges management, up-to-date systems etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3) Use Vulnerability Scanning - Preferably Continuously and Automated</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://securityforeveryone.com/products/continuous-security\" target=\"_blank\">Vulnerability scanning</a> is a process that looks for security weaknesses and potential threats in your website&rsquo;s code. By finding and fixing those vulnerabilities, you can help protect your data from hackers. To make sure your website is secure, it&rsquo;s important to use vulnerability scanning services regularly. If possible, look into automated solutions that run continuously and can alert you of any potential threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4) Keep Software Updated</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Software updates are important for keeping your website secure, as they often contain security patches and bug fixes that will prevent malicious code from affecting your website. Make sure to keep all the software running on your website up-to-date in order to ensure maximum protection. 3rd party libraries, web servers and similar software that helps maintain your website are all included in the term &quot;software&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5) Utilize SSL Certificates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Securing Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates provide an additional layer of encryption on top of traditional HTTP protocols by verifying the identity of a server before a connection is established between it and a client device (e.g., browser). SSL certificates also ensure that data transmitted over the connection remains encrypted even if someone were able to intercept it during transit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6) Perform Regular Backups</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, performing regular backups of your website&rsquo;s data can help ensure its safety against ransomware attacks or other malicious intrusions that could otherwise delete or corrupt vital information stored onsite without warning. Backups should be done at least once per week (or daily if possible) so that any changes made since then can be easily restored in case something goes wrong down the line. Additionally, make sure these backups are stored offsite so that they remain safe even if something were to happen at your primary location (e.g., natural disaster).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking steps towards improving your website&rsquo;s security posture doesn&#39;t have to be complicated&mdash;it just requires some forethought and careful planning ahead of time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By implementing strong passwords, utilizing secure hosting platforms, installing reliable antivirus software, utilizing SSL certificates for added encryption, and performing regular backups of critical data, founders, managers &amp; CTO&#39;s alike can rest assured knowing their websites are protected against potential threats both near &amp; far!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these practices in place, businesses will reap the benefits of improved cybersecurity while maintaining peace-of-mind knowing their valuable information is safe &amp; sound!</p>\r\n"
